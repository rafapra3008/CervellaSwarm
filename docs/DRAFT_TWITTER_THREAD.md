## THREAD (10 Tweets)

### Tweet 1 - HOOK

```
Most AI dev tools give you 1 smart assistant.

I built a whole team.

16 specialized agents + 3 quality guardians.

MCP-native. Open source.

After 260+ sessions with Claude, here's CervellaSwarm
```

---

### Tweet 2 - THE PROBLEM

```
The problem with AI coding tools:

- They treat senior devs like beginners
- One model = one perspective
- No quality checks (you're the reviewer)
- Context gets lost in complex projects

I needed something different.
```

---

### Tweet 3 - THE INSIGHT

```
What if AI worked like a real dev team?

- Frontend specialist for React
- Backend expert for APIs
- Tester for quality
- Researcher for best practices
- Guardians that review everything

Obvious idea. Nobody built it.

So I did.
```

---

### Tweet 4 - WHAT IT IS

```
Meet CervellaSwarm:

16 specialized agents (Sonnet)
+ 3 quality guardians (Opus)
+ MCP protocol native

It's not an assistant.
It's a team.

### Tweet 5 - HOW IT WORKS

```
How it works:

$ npx cervellaswarm task "add JWT auth"

Regina analyzes -> Spawns specialist -> Worker builds -> Guardian reviews -> Done

Right expert for each task. Quality verified.
```

---

### Tweet 6 - THE SECRET SAUCE

```
The secret sauce: Quality Guardians

3 Opus-powered agents that:
- Review architecture decisions
- Check security
- Enforce best practices

Workers BUILD.
Guardians VERIFY.

No more "AI wrote it so it must be fine"
```

---

### Tweet 7 - MCP NATIVE

```
Built MCP-native from day 1.

Works with:
- Claude Desktop
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- Any MCP client

Protocol > platform lock-in.

Future-proof by design.
```

---

### Tweet 8 - HONEST COMPARISON

```
Compare:

Cursor/Copilot: 1 AI assistant
Aider: CLI single agent (great Git!)
CervellaSwarm: Full team + quality layer

Not "better" - different approach.

Multi-agent + guardian verification.
```

---

### Tweet 9 - THE JOURNEY

```
The journey:

2 years ago: stuck in Brazil, needed change
Moved to Italy post-COVID
Found Claude
260+ work sessions later

This tool exists because I needed it.

Now it's yours.
```

```
Option A (domanda):
"What's missing from AI dev tools?

I asked myself this 260 times.

Then I built the answer."

Option B (bold statement):
"AI dev tools in 2026:
- Cursor: great IDE, 1 assistant
- Copilot: autocomplete++
- Aider: CLI wizard

None of them: a full team.

Until now."

Option C (personal):
"6 months ago I was rebuilding my life in Italy.

Today I'm launching the AI dev tool I wish existed.

Here's CervellaSwarm"
