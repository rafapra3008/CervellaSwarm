## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

### Positioning Statement

```
FOR indie developers and small teams
WHO need AI coding assistance that works like a full dev team
CERVELLASWARM is a VS Code extension with 16 specialized AI agents
THAT UNLIKE single-agent tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor
PROVIDES parallel multi-agent orchestration at an affordable price
```

### Key Messages

1. **Multi-Agent Architecture** - "Not one AI, but 16 specialists working together"
2. **Affordable Power** - "Enterprise capability at indie developer pricing"
3. **Built for Developers** - "By developers who felt the pain of bottlenecks"

---

## TOOLS & STACK

| Category | Tool | Cost/mo |
|----------|------|---------|
| Landing Page | Webflow/Framer | $20 |
| Email | ConvertKit | $29 |
| Analytics | Plausible | $9 |
| SEO | Ahrefs | $99 |
| Community | Discord | Free |
| Referrals | Rewardful | $49 |
| Payments | Stripe | 2.9% |
| Support | Intercom | $74 |

**Total:** ~$400/month

---

## RISK MITIGATION

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| GitHub Copilot adds multi-agent | Medium | Build community moat, move fast |
| Low conversion (<3%) | Medium | A/B test pricing, improve onboarding |
| High churn (>20%) | Low | Proactive success, exit surveys |

---

## THE THREE PRINCIPLES

**1. START SMALL, SCALE SMART**
```
Week 1: Landing page + 50 signups
Month 6: 3,000 users + $10K MRR

Build sustainably, learn fast, iterate constantly.
```

**2. DEVELOPERS SMELL BS**
```
❌ "Revolutionary AI that will change coding forever!"
✅ "16 agents working in parallel. Here's the architecture."

Be honest. Be technical. Show, don't tell.
```

**3. PRODUCT-LED GROWTH WORKS**
```
The best marketing is a product developers love.
Cursor got to $1B with almost ZERO paid marketing.
Build something so useful it sells itself.
```
