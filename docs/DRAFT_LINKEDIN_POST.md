## POST PRINCIPALE

```
Professional developers don't need another autocomplete.
They need a team.

After 260+ sessions with Claude, I built one: CervellaSwarm.

---

THE PROBLEM

Professional developers don't need another autocomplete.

They need:
- Specialized expertise across the entire stack
- Quality assurance they can trust
- Tools that scale to complex, real-world projects

Most AI coding tools treat senior engineers like beginners.
I built something different.

---

THE SOLUTION

CervellaSwarm is a multi-agent AI system:

- 16 specialized agents (frontend, backend, testing, research, devops, security, docs...)
- 3 quality guardians powered by Claude Opus
- MCP-native architecture (works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and any MCP client)

Workers BUILD. Guardians VERIFY.

No more "AI wrote it, ship it" without review.

---

KEY DIFFERENTIATORS

- Multi-agent coordination: right specialist for each task
- Quality layer: Opus guardians review all outputs
- Production workflows: git-aware, testing-first, documented
- Protocol-based: MCP native, no platform lock-in
- Open source: Apache-2.0 licensed

---

THE JOURNEY

Two years ago, I was stuck.
Working a job that didn't fit, living through rough times in Brazil.
Then I moved to Italy after COVID, looking for a fresh start.

I went deep on personal development. Then AI happened.
260+ Claude sessions later, CervellaSwarm exists.

Built because I needed it. Now it's yours.

## ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

**Rispondere a commenti:**

## TONE GUIDELINES

LinkedIn = Professional ma umano

**DO:**
- Personal story (journey from Brazil to Italy)

**DON'T:**
- Corporate speak ("synergy", "leverage")
- Over-hype ("revolutionary", "game-changer")
- Fake urgency ("limited time!")
- Too many emoji
