---

## TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE

### Architecture Comune

```
1. DATA INGESTION
   - Exchange API polling
   - CSV upload
   - Wallet address watching (on-chain)

2. TRANSACTION CLASSIFICATION
   - Trade (buy/sell)
   - Transfer (wallet to wallet)
   - Income (staking, mining)
   - Expense (gas fees)
   - Gift (donation)

3. COST BASIS CALCULATION
   - FIFO (First In First Out)
   - LIFO (Last In First Out)
   - HIFO (Highest In First Out)
   - Specific ID

4. TAX CALCULATION
   - Short-term capital gains (< 1 year)
   - Long-term capital gains (> 1 year)
   - Ordinary income (staking, mining)

5. REPORT GENERATION
   - Form 8949 (USA)
   - Schedule D (USA)
   - Country-specific forms
```

### Challenges Tecnici

**DEFI COMPLEXITY**:
```
Uniswap LP provision:
1. Deposit ETH + USDC → Get LP token
2. Stake LP token → Earn UNI rewards
3. Claim UNI → Taxable income?
4. Unstake LP → Get back ETH + USDC
5. Different amounts = impermanent loss

How to classify? How to value?
```

**COST BASIS HELL**:
```
Buy BTC on Coinbase $10K
Transfer to wallet (not taxable)
Swap 0.5 BTC for ETH on Uniswap (taxable!)
  → Cost basis of 0.5 BTC?
  → Fair market value at swap time?
Transfer ETH to Binance
Sell ETH for USDT (taxable!)
  → Cost basis of ETH?
```

**MISSING DATA**:
```
Exchange chiuso (FTX, etc.)
API disabled
CSV export missing
Historical prices unavailable

= IMPOSSIBLE to calculate accurate basis
```

### Technology Stack

**Backend**:
- Python (tax calculation engine)
- PostgreSQL (transaction storage)
- Redis (caching)
- Celery (background jobs)

**Data Sources**:
- Exchange APIs (REST)
- Blockchain nodes (on-chain data)
- Historical price APIs (CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap)

**Frontend**:
- React (dashboard)
- Charts (tax reports visualization)
- PDF generation (tax forms)

---

## COST BASIS ALGORITHMS

### FIFO (First In First Out)
**Most Common in USA**

Example:
```
Buy 1 BTC @ $10K (Jan 1)
Buy 1 BTC @ $20K (Feb 1)
Sell 1 BTC @ $30K (Mar 1)

Cost basis = $10K (first purchased)
Gain = $30K - $10K = $20K
```

### LIFO (Last In First Out)
Example:
```
Buy 1 BTC @ $10K (Jan 1)
Buy 1 BTC @ $20K (Feb 1)
Sell 1 BTC @ $30K (Mar 1)

Cost basis = $20K (last purchased)
Gain = $30K - $20K = $10K
```

### HIFO (Highest In First Out)
**Tax Optimization**

Example:
```
Buy 1 BTC @ $10K (Jan 1)
Buy 1 BTC @ $25K (Feb 1)
Sell 1 BTC @ $30K (Mar 1)

Cost basis = $25K (highest cost)
Gain = $30K - $25K = $5K (minimize tax)
```

### Specific ID
**Manual Selection**

User specifies quale coin vendere.
Require detailed records.
