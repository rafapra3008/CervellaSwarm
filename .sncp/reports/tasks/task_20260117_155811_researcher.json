Or if you prefer, I can help you set up a typical FastAPI project structure.\n\nBased on common FastAPI projects, I would expect to see files like:\n\n1. **main.py** - FastAPI application entry point\n2. **requirements.txt** - Python dependencies\n3. **README.md** - Project documentation\n4. **.env** - Environment variables\n5. **app/** - Application directory with routers, models, etc.\n\nWould you like me to help create a proper FastAPI project structure, or can you share what files are currently in your project?",
